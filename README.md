# Constant_adiabaticity_profile
This is a rep that contains MATLAB files needed to calculate constant adiabaticity profile for field sweeping methods

Constant_adiabaticity_profile.m - calculate the profile
FC_FS_inhom_vary.m              - calculate the dependency on the field inhoms
FC_FS_sweep_vary.m              - calculate the dependency on sweeping time
Operators.m                     - function to generate operators
